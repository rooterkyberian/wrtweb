# Webcatalog of wireless devices compatible with OpenWrt.

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/rooterkyberian/wrtweb.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/rooterkyberian/wrtweb)


The catalog is created by scrapping device info from OpenWrt wiki and then
running them against auction services to get pricing/availability information.
Of course the pricing information gathered this way can be wildly inaccurate.
For now only Poland is supported (i.e. all listed prices are in PLN).
